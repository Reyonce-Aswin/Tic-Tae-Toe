# Tic-Tac-Toe Projects

This repository contains two versions of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game:

## 1. Command Line Tic-Tac-Toe (C++)

This is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. It features:

- Two-player gameplay asking for player names,
- Player symbol assignment (X and O) displayed to users,
- Input validation for moves,
- Win and draw detection,
- Displays the winning player's name upon game completion.

The game logic is implemented across three files: `main.cpp`, `game.cpp`, and `game.h`.

## 2. Web-based Tic-Tac-Toe

In addition to the C++ console game, a web version of Tic-Tac-Toe has been developed. The web game offers:

- Interactive gameplay with a graphical user interface,
- Player name input and symbol assignment,
- Responsive design suited for various devices,
- Visual win/draw notifications.

## How to Run

### C++ Version

Compile and run the C++ project using your preferred compiler. For example, using g++:
```
g++ main.cpp game.cpp -o tic_tac_toe
./tic_tac_toe
```

### Web Version

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to play the web-based Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding an AI opponent for single-player mode,
- Enhancing the web version with animations and sound effects,
- Improving input validation and error handling.
